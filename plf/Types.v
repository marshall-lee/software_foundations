(** * Types: Type Systems *)

(** Our next major topic is _type systems_ -- static program
    analyses that classify expressions according to the "shapes" of
    their results.  We'll begin with a typed version of the simplest
    imaginable language, to introduce the basic ideas of types and
    typing rules and the fundamental theorems about type systems:
    _type preservation_ and _progress_.  In chapter [Stlc] we'll move
    on to the _simply typed lambda-calculus_, which lives at the core
    of every modern functional programming language (including
    Coq!). *)

(** * Typed Arithmetic Expressions *)

(** To motivate the discussion of type systems, let's begin as
    usual with a tiny toy language.  We want it to have the potential
    for programs to go wrong because of runtime type errors, so we
    need something a tiny bit more complex than the language of
    constants and addition that we used in chapter [Smallstep]: a
    single kind of data (e.g., numbers) is too simple, but just two
    kinds (numbers and booleans) gives us enough material to tell an
    interesting story.

    The language definition is completely routine. *)

(** Notice that the [step] relation doesn't care about whether the
    expression being stepped makes global sense -- it just checks that
    the operation in the _next_ reduction step is being applied to the
    right kinds of operands.  For example, the term <{ succ true }> cannot
    take a step, but the almost as obviously nonsensical term

       <{ succ (if true then true else true) }>

    can take a step (once, before becoming stuck). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Normal Forms and Values *)

(** The first interesting thing to notice about this [step] relation
    is that the strong progress theorem from the [Smallstep]
    chapter fails here.  That is, there are terms that are normal
    forms (they can't take a step) but not values (they are not
    included in our definition of possible "results of reduction").
    Such terms are said to be _stuck_. *)

    define things so that some value could still take a step. *)

    use an induction to reason about a term that is known to be a
    numeric value.  This induction can be performed either over the
    term itself or over the evidence that it is a numeric value.  The
    proof goes through in either case, but you will find that one way
    is quite a bit shorter than the other.  For the sake of the
    exercise, try to complete the proof both ways.)

(** ** Typing *)

(** The next critical observation is that, although this
    language has stuck terms, they are always nonsensical, mixing
    booleans and numbers in a way that we don't even _want_ to have a
    meaning.  We can easily exclude such ill-typed terms by defining a
    _typing relation_ that relates terms to the types (either numeric
    or boolean) of their final results.  *)

(** In informal notation, the typing relation is often written
    [|-- t \in T] and pronounced "[t] has type [T]."  The [|--] symbol
    is called a "turnstile."  Below, we're going to see richer typing
    relations where one or more additional "context" arguments are
    written to the left of the turnstile.  For the moment, the context
    is always empty.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (more_variations)

    Make up some exercises of your own along the same lines as
    the ones above.  Try to find ways of selectively breaking
    properties -- i.e., ways of changing the definitions that
    break just one of the properties and leave the others alone.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (remove_pred0)

    The reduction rule [ST_Pred0] is a bit counter-intuitive: we
    might feel that it makes more sense for the predecessor of [<{0}>] to
    be undefined, rather than being defined to be [<{0}>].  Can we
    achieve this simply by removing the rule from the definition of
    [step]?  Would doing so create any problems elsewhere?

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (prog_pres_bigstep)

    Suppose our evaluation relation is defined in the big-step style.
    State appropriate analogs of the progress and preservation
    properties. (You do not need to prove them.)

    Can you see any limitations of either of your properties?  Do they
    allow for nonterminating programs?  Why might we prefer the
    small-step semantics for stating preservation and progress?
