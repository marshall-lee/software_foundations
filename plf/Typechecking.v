(** * Typechecking: A Typechecker for STLC *)

(** The [has_type] relation of the STLC defines what it means for a
    term to belong to a type (in some context).  But it doesn't, by
    itself, give us an algorithm for _checking_ whether or not a term
    is well typed.

    Fortunately, the rules defining [has_type] are _syntax directed_
    -- that is, for every syntactic form of the language, there is
    just one rule that can be used to give a type to terms of that
    form.  This makes it straightforward to translate the typing rules
    into clauses of a typechecking _function_ that takes a term and a
    context and either returns the term's type or else signals that
    the term is not typable.  *)

(** This short chapter constructs such a function and proves it
    correct. *)

(** * Comparing Types *)

(** First, we need a function to compare two types for equality... *)

Locate "Bool".

Fixpoint eqb_ty (T1 T2:ty) : bool :=
  match T1,T2 with
  | <{ Bool }> , <{ Bool }> =>
      true
  | <{ T11->T12 }>, <{ T21->T22 }> =>
      andb (eqb_ty T11 T21) (eqb_ty T12 T22)
  | _,_ =>
      false
  end.

(** ... and we need to establish the usual two-way connection between
    the boolean result returned by [eqb_ty] and the logical
    proposition that its inputs are equal. *)

Lemma eqb_ty_refl : forall T,
  eqb_ty T T = true.

(** * The Typechecker *)

(** The typechecker works by walking over the structure of the given
    term, returning either [Some T] or [None].  Each time we make a
    recursive call to find out the types of the subterms, we need to
    pattern-match on the results to make sure that they are not
    [None].  Also, in the [app] case, we use pattern matching to
    extract the left- and right-hand sides of the function's arrow
    type (and fail if the type of the function is not [T11->T12]
    for some [T11] and [T12]). *)

(** * Digression: Improving the Notation *)

(** Before we consider the properties of this algorithm, let's write
    it out again in a cleaner way, using "monadic" notations in the
    style of Haskell to streamline the plumbing of options.  First, we
    define a notation for composing two potentially failing (i.e.,
    option-returning) computations: *)

Notation " x <- e1 ;; e2" := (match e1 with
                              | Some x => e2
                              | None => None
                              end)
         (right associativity, at level 60).

(** Second, we define [return] and [fail] as synonyms for [Some] and
    [None]: *)

Notation " 'return' e "
  := (Some e) (at level 60).

Notation " 'fail' "
  := None.

Module STLCChecker.
Import STLCTypes.

(** Now we can write the same type-checking function in a more
    imperative-looking style using these notations. *)

Fixpoint type_check (Gamma : context) (t : tm) : option ty :=
  match t with
  | tm_var x =>
      match Gamma x with
      | Some T => return T
      | None   => fail
      end

  | <{t1 t2}> =>
      T1 <- type_check Gamma t1 ;;
      T2 <- type_check Gamma t2 ;;
      match T1 with
      | <{T11->T12}> =>
          if eqb_ty T11 T2 then return T12 else fail
      | _ => fail
      end
  | <{true}> =>
      return <{ Bool }>
  | <{false}> =>

(** To verify that the typechecking algorithm is correct, we show that
    it is _sound_ and _complete_ for the original [has_type]
    relation -- that is, [type_check] and [has_type] define the same

    of _Logical Foundations_ as a guide, build a parser for extended
    STLC programs.  Combine it with the typechecking and stepping
    functions from the above exercises to yield a complete typechecker
