(** * Decorated Programs *)

(** The beauty of Hoare Logic is that it is _structure-guided_: the
    structure of proofs exactly follows the structure of programs.

    We can record the essential ideas of a Hoare-logic proof --
    omitting low-level calculational details -- by "decorating" a
    program with appropriate assertions on each of its commands.

    Such a _decorated program_ carries within itself an argument for
    its own correctness. *)

(** For example, consider the program:

    X := m;
    Z := p;
    while X <> 0 do
      Z := Z - 1;
      X := X - 1
    end
*)
(** Here is one possible specification for this program, in the
    form of a Hoare triple:

    {{ True }}
    X := m;
    Z := p;
    while X <> 0 do
      Z := Z - 1;
      X := X - 1
    end
    {{ Z = p - m }}
*)
(** (Note the _parameters_ [m] and [p], which stand for
   fixed-but-arbitrary numbers.  Formally, they are simply Coq
   variables of type [nat].) *)

(** Here is a decorated version of this program, embodying a
    proof of this specification:

    {{ True }} ->>
    {{ m = m }}
      X := m
                         {{ X = m }} ->>
                         {{ X = m /\ p = p }};
      Z := p;
                         {{ X = m /\ Z = p }} ->>
                         {{ Z - X = p - m }}
      while X <> 0 do
                         {{ Z - X = p - m /\ X <> 0 }} ->>
                         {{ (Z - 1) - (X - 1) = p - m }}
        Z := Z - 1
                         {{ Z - (X - 1) = p - m }};
        X := X - 1
                         {{ Z - X = p - m }}
      end
    {{ Z - X = p - m /\ ~ (X <> 0) }} ->>
    {{ Z = p - m }}
*)

(** Concretely, a decorated program consists of the program's text
    interleaved with assertions (sometimes multiple assertions
    separated by implications). *)

(** A decorated program can be viewed as a compact representation of a
    proof in Hoare Logic: the assertions surrounding each command
    specify the Hoare triple to be proved for that part of the program
    using one of the Hoare Logic rules, and the structure of the
    program itself shows how to assemble all these individual steps
    into a proof for the whole program. *)

(** Our goal is to verify such decorated programs "mostly
    automatically."  But, before we can verify anything, we need to be
    able to _find_ a proof for a given specification, and for this we
    need to discover the right assertions. This can be done in an
    almost mechanical way, with the exception of finding loop
    invariants. In the remainder of this section we explain in detail
    how to construct decorations for several short programs, all of
    which are loop-free or have simple loop invariants. We'll return
    finding more interesting loop invariants later in the chapter. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Swapping *)

(** Consider the following program, which swaps the values of two
    variables using addition and subtraction (instead of by assigning
    to a temporary variable).

       X := X + Y;
       Y := X - Y;
       X := X - Y

    We can give a proof, in the form of decorations, that this program is
    correct -- i.e., it really swaps [X] and [Y] -- as follows.

    (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }} ->>
    (2)    {{ (X + Y) - ((X + Y) - Y) = n /\ (X + Y) - Y = m }}
             X := X + Y
    (3)                     {{ X - (X - Y) = n /\ X - Y = m }};
             Y := X - Y
    (4)                     {{ X - Y = n /\ Y = m }};
             X := X - Y
    (5)    {{ X = n /\ Y = m }}

    The decorations can be constructed as follows:

      - We begin with the undecorated program (the unnumbered lines).

      - We add the specification -- i.e., the outer precondition (1)
        and postcondition (5). In the precondition, we use parameters
        [m] and [n] to remember the initial values of variables [X]
        and [Y] so that we can refer to them in the postcondition (5).

      - We work backwards, mechanically, starting from (5) and
        proceeding until we get to (2). At each step, we obtain the
        precondition of the assignment from its postcondition by
        substituting the assigned variable with the right-hand-side of
        the assignment. For instance, we obtain (4) by substituting
        [X] with [X - Y] in (5), and we obtain (3) by substituting [Y]
        with [X - Y] in (4).

    Finally, we verify that (1) logically implies (2) -- i.e., that
    the step from (1) to (2) is a valid use of the law of
    consequence -- by doing a bit of high-school algebra.
 *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Simple Conditionals *)

(** Here is a simple decorated program using conditionals:

      (1)   {{ True }}
              if X <= Y then
      (2)                    {{ True /\ X <= Y }} ->>
      (3)                    {{ (Y - X) + X = Y \/ (Y - X) + Y = X }}
                Z := Y - X
      (4)                    {{ Z + X = Y \/ Z + Y = X }}
              else
      (5)                    {{ True /\ ~(X <= Y) }} ->>
      (6)                    {{ (X - Y) + X = Y \/ (X - Y) + Y = X }}
                Z := X - Y
      (7)                    {{ Z + X = Y \/ Z + Y = X }}
              end
      (8)   {{ Z + X = Y \/ Z + Y = X }}

These decorations can be constructed as follows:

  - We start with the outer precondition (1) and postcondition (8).

  - Following the format dictated by the [hoare_if] rule, we copy the
    postcondition (8) to (4) and (7). We conjoin the precondition (1)
    with the guard of the conditional to obtain (2). We conjoin (1)
    with the negated guard of the conditional to obtain (5).

  - In order to use the assignment rule and obtain (3), we substitute
    [Z] by [Y - X] in (4). To obtain (6) we substitute [Z] by [X - Y]
    in (7).

  - Finally, we verify that (2) implies (3) and (5) implies (6). Both
    of these implications crucially depend on the ordering of [X] and
    [Y] obtained from the guard. For instance, knowing that [X <= Y]
    ensures that subtracting [X] from [Y] and then adding back [X]
    produces [Y], as required by the first disjunct of (3). Similarly,
    knowing that [~ (X <= Y)] ensures that subtracting [Y] from [X]
    and then adding back [Y] produces [X], as needed by the second
    disjunct of (6). Note that [n - m + m = n] does _not_ hold for
    arbitrary natural numbers [n] and [m] (for example, [3 - 5 + 5 =
    5]). *)

    N.b.: Although this exercise is marked optional, it is an
    excellent warm-up for the (non-optional) [if_minus_plus_correct]
    exercise below!

(*
  {{ True }}
    if X <= Y then
              {{                         }} ->>
              {{                         }}
      Z := Y - X
              {{                         }}
    else
              {{                         }} ->>
              {{                         }}
      Y := X + Z
              {{                         }}
    end
  {{ Y = X + Z }}
*)

    Briefly justify each use of [->>].
*)

(** [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Reduce to Zero *)

(** Here is a [while] loop that is so simple that [True] suffices
    as a loop invariant.

        (1)    {{ True }}
                 while X <> 0 do
        (2)                  {{ True /\ X <> 0 }} ->>
        (3)                  {{ True }}
                   X := X - 1
        (4)                  {{ True }}
                 end
        (5)    {{ True /\ ~(X <> 0) }} ->>
        (6)    {{ X = 0 }}

   The decorations can be constructed as follows:

     - Start with the outer precondition (1) and postcondition (6).

     - Following the format dictated by the [hoare_while] rule, we copy
       (1) to (4). We conjoin (1) with the guard to obtain (2). We also
       conjoin (1) with the negation of the guard to obtain (5).

     - Because the final postcondition (6) does not syntactically match (5),
       we add an implication between them.

     - Using the assignment rule with assertion (4), we trivially substitute
       and obtain assertion (3).

     - We add the implication between (2) and (3).

   Finally we check that the implications do hold; both are trivial. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Division *)

(** Let's do one more example of simple reasoning about a loop.

    The following Imp program calculates the integer quotient and
    remainder of parameters [m] and [n].

       X := m;
       Y := 0;
       while n <= X do
         X := X - n;
         Y := Y + 1
       end;

    If we replace [m] and [n] by concrete numbers and execute the program, it
    will terminate with the variable [X] set to the remainder when [m]
    is divided by [n] and [Y] set to the quotient. *)

(** In order to give a specification to this program we need to
    remember that dividing [m] by [n] produces a remainder [X] and a
    quotient [Y] such that [n * Y + X = m /\ X < n].

    It turns out that we get lucky with this program and don't have to
    think very hard about the loop invariant: the invariant is just
    the first conjunct, [n * Y + X = m], and we can use this to
    decorate the program.

      (1)  {{ True }} ->>
      (2)  {{ n * 0 + m = m }}
             X := m;
      (3)                     {{ n * 0 + X = m }}
             Y := 0;
      (4)                     {{ n * Y + X = m }}
             while n <= X do
      (5)                     {{ n * Y + X = m /\ n <= X }} ->>
      (6)                     {{ n * (Y + 1) + (X - n) = m }}
               X := X - n;
      (7)                     {{ n * (Y + 1) + X = m }}
               Y := Y + 1
      (8)                     {{ n * Y + X = m }}
             end
      (9)  {{ n * Y + X = m /\ ~ (n <= X) }} ->>
     (10)  {{ n * Y + X = m /\ X < n }}

    Assertions (4), (5), (8), and (9) are derived mechanically from
    the invariant and the loop's guard.  Assertions (8), (7), and (6)
    are derived using the assignment rule going backwards from (8)
    to (6).  Assertions (4), (3), and (2) are again backwards
    applications of the assignment rule.

    Now that we've decorated the program it only remains to check that
    the uses of the consequence rule are correct -- i.e., that (1)
    implies (2), that (5) implies (6), and that (9) implies (10). This
    is indeed the case:
      - (1) ->> (2):  trivial, by algebra.
      - (5) ->> (6):  because [n <= X], we are guaranteed that the
        subtraction in (6) does not get zero-truncated.  We can
        therefore rewrite (6) as [n * Y + n + X - n] and cancel the
        [n]s, which results in the left conjunct of (5).
      - (9) ->> (10):  if [~ (n <= X)] then [X < n].  That's straightforward
        from high-school algebra.
    So, we have a valid decorated program. *)

    The following declaration introduces a more sophisticated tactic
    that will help with proving assertions throughout the rest of this
    chapter.  You don't need to understand the details, but briefly:
    it uses [split] repeatedly to turn all the conjunctions into
    separate subgoals, tries to use several theorems about booleans
    and (in)equalities, then uses [eauto] and [lia] to finish off as
    many subgoals as possible. What's left after [verify_assn] does

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Formal Decorated Programs *)

(** Our informal conventions for decorated programs amount to a
    way of "displaying" Hoare triples, in which commands are annotated
    with enough embedded assertions that checking the validity of a
    triple is reduced to simple logical and algebraic calculations
    showing that some assertions imply others.

    In this section, we show that this presentation style can be made
    completely formal -- and indeed that checking the validity of
    decorated programs can be largely automated.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** The first thing we need to do is to formalize a variant of
    the syntax of commands that includes embedded assertions --
    decorations.  We call the new commands _decorated commands_, or
    [dcom]s.

    The choice of exactly where to put assertions in the definition of
    [dcom] is a bit subtle.  The simplest thing to do would be to
    annotate every [dcom] with a precondition and postcondition.  But
    this would result in very verbose decorated programs with a lot of
    repeated annotations: for example, a program like [skip;skip]
    would be decorated like this

        {{P}} ({{P}} skip {{P}}) ; ({{P}} skip {{P}}) {{P}}

    with pre- and post-conditions around each [skip], plus identical
    pre- and post-conditions on the semicolon!

    In other words, we don't want both preconditions and
    postconditions on each command, because a sequence of two commands
    would contain redundant decorations--the postcondition of the
    first likely being the same as the precondition of the second.

    Instead, the formal syntax of decorated commands omits
    preconditions whenever possible, trying to embed just the
    postcondition. *)

(** Concretely, we decorate programs as follows... *)

(** - The [skip] command is decorated only with its postcondition

      skip {{ Q }}

      on the assumption that the precondition will be provided by the
      context.

      We carry the same assumption through the other syntactic forms:
      each decorated command is assumed to carry its own postcondition
      within itself but take its precondition from its context in
      which it is used.
*)

(** - Sequences [d1 ; d2] need no additional decorations.

      Why?  Inside [d2] there will be a postcondition; this serves as
      the postcondition of [d1;d2].  Inside [d1] there will also be
      a postcondition, which additionally serves as the precondition
      for [d2]. *)

(** - An assignment [X := a] is decorated only with its postcondition:

      X := a {{ Q }}
*)

(** - A conditional [if b then d1 else d2] is decorated with a
      postcondition for the entire statement, as well as preconditions
      for each branch:

      if b then {{ P1 }} d1 else {{ P2 }} d2 end {{ Q }}
*)

(** - A loop [while b do d end] is decorated with its postcondition
      and a precondition for the body:

      while b do {{ P }} d end {{ Q }}

      The postcondition embedded in [d] serves as the loop invariant. *)

(** - Implications [->>] can be added as decorations either for a
      precondition

      ->> {{ P }} d

      or for a postcondition

      d ->> {{ Q }}

      The former is waiting for another precondition to eventually be
      supplied (e.g., [{{ P'}} ->> {{ P }} d]); the latter relies on
      the postcondition already embedded in [d]. *)

(** Here's the formal syntax of decorated commands: *)

Inductive dcom : Type :=
| DCSkip (Q : Assertion)
  (* skip {{ Q }} *)
| DCSeq (d1 d2 : dcom)
  (* d1 ; d2 *)
| DCAsgn (X : string) (a : aexp) (Q : Assertion)
  (* X := a {{ Q }} *)
| DCIf (b : bexp) (P1 : Assertion) (d1 : dcom)
       (P2 : Assertion) (d2 : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
  (* if b then {{ P1 }} d1 else {{ P2 }} d2 end {{ Q }} *)
| DCWhile (b : bexp) (P : Assertion) (d : dcom)
          (Q : Assertion)
  (* while b do {{ P }} d end {{ Q }} *)
| DCPre (P : Assertion) (d : dcom)
  (* ->> {{ P }} d *)
| DCPost (d : dcom) (Q : Assertion)
  (* d ->> {{ Q }} *).

(** To provide the initial precondition that goes at the very top of a
    decorated program, we introduce a new type [decorated]: *)

Inductive decorated : Type :=
  | Decorated : Assertion -> dcom -> decorated.

(** To avoid clashing with the existing [Notation]s for ordinary
    [com]mands, we introduce these notations in a new grammar scope
    called [dcom]. *)

Declare Scope dcom_scope.

      := (DCSkip P)
      (in custom com at level 0, P constr) : dcom_scope.

    decorations sprinkled through the program.

    because they are the facts that must be verified to see that the
    decorations are locally consistent and thus constitute a proof of
    correctness. *)

    [d] together with a precondition [P] and returns a _proposition_
    that, if it can be proved, implies that the triple

    is valid.

    It does this by walking over [d] and generating a big conjunction
    that includes

    - local consistency checks for each form of command, plus

    - uses of [->>] to bridge the gap between the assertions found
      inside a decorated command and the assertions imposed by its
      context; these uses correspond to applications of the
      consequence rule. *)

(** * Finding Loop Invariants *)

(** Once the outermost precondition and postcondition are
    chosen, the only creative part of a verifying program using Hoare
    Logic is finding the right loop invariants.  The reason this is
    difficult is the same as the reason that inductive mathematical
    proofs are:

    - Strengthening a _loop invariant_ means that you have a stronger
      assumption to work with when trying to establish the
      postcondition of the loop body, but it also means that the loop
      body's postcondition is stronger and thus harder to prove.

    - Strengthening an _induction hypothesis_ means that you have a
      stronger assumption to work with when trying to complete the
      induction step of the proof, but it also means that the
      statement being proved inductively is stronger and thus harder
      to prove.

    This section explains how to approach the challenge of finding
    loop invariants through a series of examples and exercises. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Slow Subtraction *)

(** The following program subtracts the value of [X] from the value of
    [Y] by repeatedly decrementing both [X] and [Y].  We want to verify its
    correctness with respect to the pre- and postconditions shown:

           {{ X = m /\ Y = n }}
             while X <> 0 do
               Y := Y - 1;
               X := X - 1
             end
           {{ Y = n - m }}
*)

(** To verify this program, we need to find an invariant [Inv] for the
    loop.  As a first step we can leave [Inv] as an unknown and build a
    _skeleton_ for the proof by applying the rules for local
    consistency, working from the end of the program to the beginning,
    as usual, and without any thinking at all yet. *)

(** This leads to the following skeleton:

        (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }}  ->>                   (a)
        (2)    {{ Inv }}
                 while X <> 0 do
        (3)              {{ Inv /\ X <> 0 }}  ->>          (c)
        (4)              {{ Inv [X |-> X-1] [Y |-> Y-1] }}
                   Y := Y - 1;
        (5)              {{ Inv [X |-> X-1] }}
                   X := X - 1
        (6)              {{ Inv }}
                 end
        (7)    {{ Inv /\ ~ (X <> 0) }}  ->>                (b)
        (8)    {{ Y = n - m }}
*)
(** By examining this skeleton, we can see that any valid [Inv] will
    have to respect three conditions:
    - (a) it must be _weak_ enough to be implied by the loop's
      precondition, i.e., (1) must imply (2);
    - (b) it must be _strong_ enough to imply the program's postcondition,
      i.e., (7) must imply (8);
    - (c) it must be _preserved_ by each iteration of the loop (given
      that the loop guard evaluates to true), i.e., (3) must imply (4). *)

(** These conditions are actually independent of the particular
    program and specification we are considering: every loop
    invariant has to satisfy them.

    One way to find an invariant that simultaneously satisfies these
    three conditions is by using an iterative process: start with a
    "candidate" invariant (e.g., a guess or a heuristic choice) and
    check the three conditions above; if any of the checks fails, try
    to use the information that we get from the failure to produce
    another -- hopefully better -- candidate invariant, and repeat.

    For instance, in the reduce-to-zero example above, we saw that,
    for a very simple loop, choosing [True] as an invariant did the
    job.  Maybe it will work here too.  To find out, let's try
    instantiating [Inv] with [True] in the skeleton above and
    see what we get...

        (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }} ->>                    (a - OK)
        (2)    {{ True }}
                 while X <> 0 do
        (3)                   {{ True /\ X <> 0 }} ->>     (c - OK)
        (4)                   {{ True }}
                   Y := Y - 1;
        (5)                   {{ True }}
                   X := X - 1
        (6)                   {{ True }}
                 end
        (7)    {{ True /\ ~(X <> 0) }} ->>                 (b - WRONG!)
        (8)    {{ Y = n - m }}

    While conditions (a) and (c) are trivially satisfied,
    (b) is wrong: it is not the case that [True /\ X = 0] (7)
    implies [Y = n - m] (8).  In fact, the two assertions are
    completely unrelated, so it is very easy to find a counterexample
    to the implication (say, [Y = X = m = 0] and [n = 1]).

    If we want (b) to hold, we need to strengthen the invariant so
    that it implies the postcondition (8).  One simple way to do
    this is to let the invariant _be_ the postcondition.  So let's
    return to our skeleton, instantiate [Inv] with [Y = n - m], and
    try checking conditions (a) to (c) again.

    (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }} ->>                        (a - WRONG!)
    (2)    {{ Y = n - m }}
             while X <> 0 do
    (3)                     {{ Y = n - m /\ X <> 0 }} ->>  (c - WRONG!)
    (4)                     {{ Y - 1 = n - m }}
               Y := Y - 1;
    (5)                     {{ Y = n - m }}
               X := X - 1
    (6)                     {{ Y = n - m }}
             end
    (7)    {{ Y = n - m /\ ~(X <> 0) }} ->>                (b - OK)
    (8)    {{ Y = n - m }}

    This time, condition (b) holds trivially, but (a) and (c) are
    broken. Condition (a) requires that (1) [X = m /\ Y = n]
    implies (2) [Y = n - m].  If we substitute [Y] by [n] we have to
    show that [n = n - m] for arbitrary [m] and [n], which is not
    the case (for instance, when [m = n = 1]).  Condition (c) requires
    that [n - m - 1 = n - m], which fails, for instance, for [n = 1]
    and [m = 0]. So, although [Y = n - m] holds at the end of the loop,
    it does not hold from the start, and it doesn't hold on each
    iteration; it is not a correct invariant.

    This failure is not very surprising: the variable [Y] changes
    during the loop, while [m] and [n] are constant, so the assertion
    we chose didn't have much chance of being an invariant!

    To do better, we need to generalize (8) to some statement that is
    equivalent to (8) when [X] is [0], since this will be the case
    when the loop terminates, and that "fills the gap" in some
    appropriate way when [X] is nonzero.  Looking at how the loop
    works, we can observe that [X] and [Y] are decremented together
    until [X] reaches [0].  So, if [X = 2] and [Y = 5] initially,
    after one iteration of the loop we obtain [X = 1] and [Y = 4];
    after two iterations [X = 0] and [Y = 3]; and then the loop stops.
    Notice that the difference between [Y] and [X] stays constant
    between iterations: initially, [Y = n] and [X = m], and the
    difference is always [n - m].  So let's try instantiating [Inv] in
    the skeleton above with [Y - X = n - m].

    (1)    {{ X = m /\ Y = n }} ->>                            (a - OK)
    (2)    {{ Y - X = n - m }}
             while X <> 0 do
    (3)                    {{ Y - X = n - m /\ X <> 0 }} ->>   (c - OK)
    (4)                    {{ (Y - 1) - (X - 1) = n - m }}
               Y := Y - 1;
    (5)                    {{ Y - (X - 1) = n - m }}
               X := X - 1
    (6)                    {{ Y - X = n - m }}
             end
    (7)    {{ Y - X = n - m /\ ~(X <> 0) }} ->>                (b - OK)
    (8)    {{ Y = n - m }}

    Success!  Conditions (a), (b) and (c) all hold now.  (To
    verify (c), we need to check that, under the assumption that [X <>
    0], we have [Y - X = (Y - 1) - (X - 1)]; this holds for all
    natural numbers [X] and [Y].)

(** ** Example: Parity *)

(** Here is a cute way of computing the parity of a value initially
    stored in [X], due to Daniel Cristofani.

       {{ X = m }}
         while 2 <= X do
           X := X - 2
         end
       {{ X = parity m }}

    The [parity] function used in the specification is defined in
    Coq as follows: *)

Fixpoint parity x :=
  match x with
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | S (S x') => parity x'
  end.

(** The postcondition does not hold at the beginning of the loop,
    since [m = parity m] does not hold for an arbitrary [m], so we
    cannot hope to use that as an invariant.  To find an invariant that works,
    let's think a bit about what this loop does.  On each iteration it
    decrements [X] by [2], which preserves the parity of [X].  So the
    parity of [X] does not change, i.e., it is invariant.  The initial
    value of [X] is [m], so the parity of [X] is always equal to the
    parity of [m]. Using [parity X = parity m] as an invariant we
    obtain the following decorated program:

      {{ X = m }} ->>                                         (a - OK)
      {{ parity X = parity m }}
        while 2 <= X do
                     {{ parity X = parity m /\ 2 <= X }} ->>  (c - OK)
                     {{ parity (X-2) = parity m }}
          X := X - 2
                     {{ parity X = parity m }}
        end
      {{ parity X = parity m /\ ~(2 <= X) }} ->>              (b - OK)
      {{ X = parity m }}

    With this invariant, conditions (a), (b), and (c) are all
    satisfied. For verifying (b), we observe that, when [X < 2], we
    have [parity X = X] (we can easily see this in the definition of
    [parity]).  For verifying (c), we observe that, when [2 <= X], we
    have [parity X = parity (X-2)]. *)

    Translate the above informal decorated program into a formal one
    and prove it correct.

    Hint: There are actually several possible loop invariants that all
    lead to good proofs; one that leads to a particularly simple proof
    is [parity X = parity m /\ 2 <= X] -- or more formally, using the
    [ap] operator to lift the application of the [parity] function
    into the syntax of assertions, [{{ ap parity X = parity m /\ 2 <=
    X }}]. *)

(** ** Example: Finding Square Roots *)

(** The following program computes the integer square root of [X]
    by naive iteration:

    {{ X=m }}
      Z := 0;
      while (Z+1)*(Z+1) <= X do
        Z := Z+1
      end
    {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }}
*)

(** As we did before, we can try to use the postcondition as a
    candidate invariant, obtaining the following decorated program:

    (1)  {{ X=m }} ->>                   (a - second conjunct of (2) WRONG!)
    (2)  {{ 0*0 <= m /\ m<(0+1)*(0+1) }}
            Z := 0
    (3)            {{ Z*Z <= m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }};
            while (Z+1)*(Z+1) <= X do
    (4)            {{ Z*Z<=m /\ (Z+1)*(Z+1)<=X }} ->>            (c - WRONG!)
    (5)            {{ (Z+1)*(Z+1)<=m /\ m<((Z+1)+1)*((Z+1)+1) }}
              Z := Z+1
    (6)            {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }}
            end
    (7)  {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) /\ ~((Z+1)*(Z+1)<=X) }} ->>  (b - OK)
    (8)  {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }}

    This didn't work very well: conditions (a) and (c) both failed.
    Looking at condition (c), we see that the second conjunct of (4)
    is almost the same as the first conjunct of (5), except that (4)
    mentions [X] while (5) mentions [m]. But note that [X] is never
    assigned in this program, so we should always have [X=m]. We
    didn't propagate this information from (1) into the loop
    invariant, but we could!

    Also, we don't need the second conjunct of (8), since we can
    obtain it from the negation of the guard -- the third conjunct
    in (7) -- again under the assumption that [X=m].  This allows
    us to simplify a bit.

    So we now try [X=m /\ Z*Z <= m] as the loop invariant:

    {{ X=m }} ->>                                           (a - OK)
    {{ X=m /\ 0*0 <= m }}
      Z := 0
                 {{ X=m /\ Z*Z <= m }};
      while (Z+1)*(Z+1) <= X do
                 {{ X=m /\ Z*Z<=m /\ (Z+1)*(Z+1)<=X }} ->>  (c - OK)
                 {{ X=m /\ (Z+1)*(Z+1)<=m }}
        Z := Z + 1
                 {{ X=m /\ Z*Z<=m }}
      end
    {{ X=m /\ Z*Z<=m /\ ~((Z+1)*(Z+1)<=X) }} ->>            (b - OK)
    {{ Z*Z<=m /\ m<(Z+1)*(Z+1) }}

    This works, since conditions (a), (b), and (c) are now all
    trivially satisfied.

    Very often, when a variable is used in a loop in a read-only
    fashion (i.e., it is referred to by the program or by the
    specification and it is not changed by the loop), it is necessary
    to record the fact that it doesn't change in the loop invariant. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Example: Squaring *)

(** Here is a program that squares [X] by repeated addition:

  {{ X = m }}
    Y := 0;
    Z := 0;
    while Y <> X  do
      Z := Z + X;
      Y := Y + 1
    end
  {{ Z = m*m }}
*)

(** The first thing to note is that the loop reads [X] but doesn't
    change its value. As we saw in the previous example, it can be a good idea
    in such cases to add [X = m] to the invariant.  The other thing
    that we know is often useful in the invariant is the postcondition,
    so let's add that too, leading to the candidate invariant
    [Z = m * m /\ X = m].

    {{ X = m }} ->>                                       (a - WRONG)
    {{ 0 = m*m /\ X = m }}
      Y := 0
                   {{ 0 = m*m /\ X = m }};
      Z := 0
                   {{ Z = m*m /\ X = m }};
      while Y <> X do
                   {{ Z = m*m /\ X = m /\ Y <> X }} ->>   (c - WRONG)
                   {{ Z+X = m*m /\ X = m }}
        Z := Z + X
                   {{ Z = m*m /\ X = m }};
        Y := Y + 1
                   {{ Z = m*m /\ X = m }}
      end
    {{ Z = m*m /\ X = m /\ ~(Y <> X) }} ->>               (b - OK)
    {{ Z = m*m }}

    Conditions (a) and (c) fail because of the [Z = m*m] part.  While
    [Z] starts at [0] and works itself up to [m*m], we can't expect
    [Z] to be [m*m] from the start.  If we look at how [Z] progresses
    in the loop, after the 1st iteration [Z = m], after the 2nd
    iteration [Z = 2*m], and at the end [Z = m*m].  Since the variable
    [Y] tracks how many times we go through the loop, this leads us to
    derive a new invariant candidate: [Z = Y*m /\ X = m].

    {{ X = m }} ->>                                        (a - OK)
    {{ 0 = 0*m /\ X = m }}
      Y := 0;
                    {{ 0 = Y*m /\ X = m }}
      Z := 0;
                    {{ Z = Y*m /\ X = m }}
      while Y <> X do
                    {{ Z = Y*m /\ X = m /\ Y <> X }} ->>   (c - OK)
                    {{ Z+X = (Y+1)*m /\ X = m }}
        Z := Z + X;
                    {{ Z = (Y+1)*m /\ X = m }}
        Y := Y + 1
                    {{ Z = Y*m /\ X = m }}
      end
    {{ Z = Y*m /\ X = m /\ ~(Y <> X) }} ->>                (b - OK)
    {{ Z = m*m }}

    This new invariant makes the proof go through: all three
    conditions are easy to check.

    It is worth comparing the postcondition [Z = m*m] and the [Z =
    Y*m] conjunct of the invariant. It is often the case that one has
    to replace parameters with variables -- or with expressions
    involving both variables and parameters, like [m - Y] -- when
    going from postconditions to invariants. *)

(** * Weakest Preconditions (Optional) *)

(** Some preconditions are more interesting than others.
    For example, the Hoare triple

      {{ False }}  X := Y + 1  {{ X <= 5 }}

    is _not_ very interesting: although it is perfectly valid , it
    tells us nothing useful.  Since the precondition isn't
    satisfied by any state, it doesn't describe any situations where
    we can use the command [X := Y + 1] to achieve the postcondition
    [X <= 5].

    By contrast,

      {{ Y <= 4 /\ Z = 0 }}  X := Y + 1 {{ X <= 5 }}

    has a useful precondition: it tells us that, if we can somehow
    create a situation in which we know that [Y <= 4 /\ Z = 0], then
    running this command will produce a state satisfying the
    postcondition.  However, this precondition is not as useful as it
    could be, because the [Z = 0] clause in the precondition actually
    has nothing to do with the postcondition [X <= 5].

    The _most_ useful precondition for this command is this one:

      {{ Y <= 4 }}  X := Y + 1  {{ X <= 5 }}

    The assertion [Y <= 4] is called the _weakest precondition_ of
    [X := Y + 1] with respect to the postcondition [X <= 5]. *)

(** Assertion [Y <= 4] is a _weakest precondition_ of command [X :=
    Y + 1] with respect to postcondition [X <= 5].  Think of _weakest_
    here as meaning "easiest to satisfy": a weakest precondition is
    one that as many states as possible can satisfy. *)

(** [P] is a weakest precondition of command [c] for postcondition [Q]
    if

      - [P] is a precondition, that is, [{{P}} c {{Q}}]; and
      - [P] is at least as weak as all other preconditions, that is,
        if [{{P'}} c {{Q}}] then [P' ->> P].
 *)

(** Note that weakest preconditions need not be unique.  For
    example, [Y <= 4] was a weakest precondition above, but so are the
    logically equivalent assertions [Y < 5], [Y <= 2 * 2], etc.  *)

    The Fibonacci function is usually written like this:

        | 1 => 1
        | _ => fib (pred n) + fib (pred (pred n))

   This doesn't pass Coq's termination checker, but here is a
   slightly clunkier definition that does: *)

Fixpoint fib n :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n' => match n' with

    The formal decorated programs defined in this section are intended
    to look as similar as possible to the informal ones defined
    earlier.  If we drop this requirement, we can eliminate almost all
    annotations, just requiring final postconditions and loop
    invariants to be provided explicitly.  Do this -- i.e., define a
    new version of dcom with as few annotations as possible and adapt
    the rest of the formal development leading up to the
    [verification_correct] theorem. *)
